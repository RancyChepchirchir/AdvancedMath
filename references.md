This is a list of references related to Advanced Mathematics,
[Mathematical Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_physics),
and other topics of interest.


- Alonso Sepulveda Soto. Fı́sica matemática (Spanish). Ciencia y Tecnologı́a.
  Universidad de Antioquia, 2009.

  This is a nice little book about Mathematical Physics. I think that it covers
  most of the relevant topics and it is short enough. The only caveat is the
  jargon, that it might be a little bit too specific for physicists.

- Erwin Kreyszig. Advanced engineering mathematics. John Wiley & Sons, 2010.

  A good book in Advanced Mathematics (for engineers). The only but is its
  extension, that would not make it suitable for a one-semester course. But,
  definitely a good book to have in one's bookshelf.

- Stanley J Farlow. Partial differential equations for scientists and
  engineers. Courier Corporation, 2012.

  This is a [PDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_differential_equation)
  book intended for students in areas other than mathematics who are studying
  partial differential equations. It presents the content in 47 _independent_
  lessons instead of presenting it by chapters.

- H. Hochstadt. Differential equations: a modern approach. Courier Dover
  Publications, 1975.

  My favorite book on [ODE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_differential_equation),
  it does not describe all the common methods for second order equations as is
  common in most ODE books. The emphasis is on concepts and in matrix methods
  that are more algorithmic, in my opinion.

- Antonio Velasco and Ruben Sánchez. Curso Básico de Álgebra Lineal (Spanish).
  Comex, 1980.

  Yet another little book that I like. It does not give any special treatment
  to the topics of linear algebra, but it is short (208 page), so you can read
  it pretty   fast. If I had to choose a book with a different approach it would
  be   [_Coding the Matrix_](http://codingthematrix.com/) by Philip N. Klein,
  that gives an intertwined presentation between theory, concepts and
  (Python) programming.

- Louis Leithold. The calculus. New York, USA: Harper and Row Publishers,
  7 edition, 1995.

  I like this calculus book, but it is probably because I studied in my
  undergrad with it. Regarding vector calculus, I find more useful the book
  by Stewart.

  Springer, 2017.

  This is a book on Finite Difference methods for PDEs. It has a stronger
  emphasis on computer implementation and verification, key aspects of
  scientific computing.

  Springer, 2017.

  This book is centered on scaling of differential equations. Rewriting
  differential equations in dimensionless form has several advantages.
  These advantages are also present in numerical solutions.

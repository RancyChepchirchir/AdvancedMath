# Objectives

At the end of the course the student should be able to use mathematical methods
to solve engineering problems. Particularly, the student should

- Understand different vector operators in several coordinate systems.
- Solve ordinary differential equation of second order.
- Apply mathematical methods to solve common boundary value problems: Laplace,
  Poisson, Wave and Heat equations.
- Identify types of equations and decide the method to solve it.
- Identify the origin of some special functions and understand some of their
  properties.

# Textbook

The main books for the course are "Física Matemática" by Alonso Sepúlveda and
"Advanced Engineering Mathematics" by Kreyszig (there
are several copies in the library).

------------------

# GitHub repository

I will create contents such as Jupyter Notebooks and Slides (and maybe some
other types) regularly into the following repository

    https://github.com/nicoguaro/AdvancedMath

------------------

# Python Distribution

I recommend to use [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) as Python
distribution, it includes SymPy and Jupyter already.

A good Python tutorial for scientific purpose is

- Gaël Varoquaux, Emmanuelle Gouillart and Olav Vahtras.
  [Scipy Lecture Notes](http://www.scipy-lectures.org/index.html)

And I wrote a short tutorial for SymPy. You can find it in the course GitHub's
repository, or follow this
[link](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/nicoguaro/AdvancedMath/blob/master/Notebooks/SymPy/SymPy_in_10_minutes.ipynb).

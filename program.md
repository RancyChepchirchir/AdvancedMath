# Advanced mathematics for engineers

## Description

This is a course of mathematical methods for beginning graduate and senior
engineering students. The topics presented in this course pretend to be
and appetizer for the student, allowing her to self-study engineering
systems that involve mathematical models not covered in basic engineering
subjects.


## Objectives

At the end of the course the student should be able to use mathematical
models to solve engineering problems. In particular, the students
should

-   Understand different vector operators in several coordinate
    systems.

-   Solve second order ordinary differential equations.

-   Apply mathematical methods to solve important boundary value problems:
    Laplace, Poisson, Wave and Heat equations.

-   Identify types of equations and decide the method to solve it.

-   Identify the origin of some special functions and understand some of
    their property.


## Methodology

Lectures, Examples, recommended reading. The course is divided in 5 units,
emphasizing the concepts. For this reason is suggested the use of a [Computer
Algebra System (CAS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_algebra_system)
such as Maple, [Maxima](http://maxima.sourceforge.net/) or
[SymPy](http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html). The instructor will show examples
using SymPy. There will be assignments for each unit that will help to
reinforce the understanding of the topics.
